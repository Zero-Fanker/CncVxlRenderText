# CncVxlRenderText
A VXL drawing lib by [@ThomasSneddon](https://github.com/ThomasSneddon) for TS/YR.

## Note
Currently, This program uses `Visual Studio 2022 (v143)` with `/std:c++latest` to build.

This program can be only compiled under x86 mode currently.

It used STL functions everywhere, and without optimization, it will run at a very low speed.

So it's not recommend to use `Debug` mode to compile this program, unless you **really** want to debug it.
